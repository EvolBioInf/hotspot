# NB: These mouse hotspot data by Smagulova et al. (2011) are provided 
#   as part of the hotspot software package for designing
#   allele-specific primers and oligos (Odenthal-Hesse et al., 2016). 
#   The hotspot coordinates by Smagulova et al. refer to mm9 and 
#   will therefore not match the current mouse assembly.
